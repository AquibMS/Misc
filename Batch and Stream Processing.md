# ![Stream Processing](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/2406/2406849.png) Stream Processing Architecture

#### Overview
**Stream processing architecture** involves continuous processing of data as it arrives. This approach is designed for real-time analytics and event-driven applications. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its components:

#### Components

1. **Data Sources**:
   - **Sensors and IoT Devices**: Continuous data from sensors and IoT devices.
   - **Application Logs**: Real-time logs from applications.
   - **Message Queues**: Data from message brokers like [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), RabbitMQ, or [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/).
   - **APIs**: Real-time data fetched from APIs.

2. **Data Ingestion**:
   - **Stream Ingestion Tools**: Tools like [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/), or [Google Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub).

- **Advantages**: Low latency, continuous processing, scalability, fault tolerance.
- **Disadvantages**: Complexity, resource intensity, consistency challenges.

In summary, batch processing is suitable for applications requiring high-throughput and periodic data processing, while stream processing is essential for real-time, low-latency applications and continuous data flows. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the use case, including the nature of the data, processing latency, and resource constraints.
